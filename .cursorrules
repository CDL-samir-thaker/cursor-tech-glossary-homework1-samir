# Project Rules and Custom Commands

## Custom Command: /exec-review-polish

### Purpose
Polish selected HTML markup for executive review presentations with improved typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

### When to Use
Run this command on selected HTML elements (cards, headers, sections, or any content blocks) that need to be presentation-ready for stakeholder reviews.

### Instructions for AI Assistant

When the user runs `/exec-review-polish` on selected HTML:

1. **Typography & Spacing**
   - Improve line-height, letter-spacing, and font sizes for easy scanning
   - Add appropriate margin/padding to create visual breathing room
   - Ensure headings have clear hierarchy (size, weight, spacing)

2. **Visual Distinction**
   - Make key labels (status, owner, titles, metadata) visually distinct
   - Use bold, color, or background to highlight important information
   - Ensure scannable patterns (e.g., labels aligned, consistent positioning)

3. **Accessibility Requirements**
   - Maintain WCAG AA color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text)
   - Use readable font sizes (minimum 14px for body, 16px+ preferred)
   - Add ARIA labels where appropriate
   - Ensure keyboard navigation support

4. **Content Preservation**
   - Keep all data and wording exactly as-is
   - Do NOT change text content, values, or information
   - Only modify HTML structure, CSS classes, and presentation

5. **Scope of Changes**
   - Prefer small, focused improvements over full rewrites
   - Focus on the selected section only
   - Use existing CSS classes/frameworks when possible
   - Add minimal custom CSS if needed
   - Maintain consistency with the rest of the project

6. **Executive Review Optimization**
   - Prioritize scannability: key info should be found in <3 seconds
   - Use visual weight to guide attention to important elements
   - Create clear visual separation between sections
   - Ensure information hierarchy is immediately obvious

### Example Improvements
- Status badges: Make them prominent with good contrast
- Titles: Increase font size, add spacing, make bold
- Metadata: Use subtle styling (smaller text, muted colors)
- Sections: Add clear borders or background colors for separation
- Lists: Improve bullet/number styling, increase spacing
- Tables: Add zebra striping, bold headers, align content

### Output
Provide the modified HTML/CSS with clear comments explaining what was improved and why.
